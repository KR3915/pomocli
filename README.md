### What is pomodoro
The Pomodoro Technique is a simple way to manage your time. You work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After doing that four times, you take a longer break, like 15 to 30 minutes. It helps you stay focused and get things done without burning out.
## How to use
just run the `pomocli` command in your terminal and it will start the timer with the config
### Why i made this project
i needed pomodoro that can run in terminal and i can just adjust the time and messages in config instead of typing the time everytime i want to start the pomodoro and i am also learning rust so i made it myself
